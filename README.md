# CRUD-TODO

Welcome to the To-Do List project! This project allows you to manage your tasks efficiently with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The data is stored locally, and you can categorise on the basis of filters such as completed or pending.

## Features

1. Create: Add new tasks to your to-do list with ease. Specify the task name and press Enter key.

2. Read: View your entire to-do list at a glance. Tasks are displayed in a clear and organized manner.

3. Update: Edit existing tasks to reflect changes. You can modify task details, such as task name, or whether is it completed or still pending.

4. Delete: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks from your list. Keep your to-do list clutter-free.

5. Status:
   - All: This filter will display all the tasks whether completed or pending.
   - Completed: This filter will display the completed tasks.
   - Pending: This filter will display only those tasks which have not been completed yet.
